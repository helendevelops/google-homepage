Hello, my name is Helen!

This is my Google Homepage, which I am very proud of. The HTML portion was pretty simple, and I tried keep the coding as clean as possible. The CSS part was a tad bit more tedious for me. I wish I was able to add the search icon and the microphone in the search bar. 

I hope you enjoy it! This project was satisfying to code, especially with my end result.
